Generating Jokes with a Sequence-to-Sequence Model
=============

Sequence-to-sequence model for generating jokes using the [tensorflow seq2seq tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/tutorials/seq2seq/). The input to the model is a question ("Why did the chicken cross the road") and the output is the answer ("To get to the other side"). The model was trained using the data from [reddit.com/r/Jokes](reddit.com/r/Jokes). <br>

This was done as the final project for my Machine Learning class. For more information about the training see the [report](https://github.com/jiriroz/JokeGeneratorSeq2Seq/blob/master/report/report.pdf).
